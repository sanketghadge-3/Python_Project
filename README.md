Prerequisites Python 3.x (recommended 3.9+)

pip (Python package installer)

Installation Steps Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/sanketghadge-3/IMS.git cd IMS

Install dependencies: (If you have a requirements.txt file, use the following. Otherwise, you might need to manually install any specific Python libraries you use beyond tkinter and sqlite3 which are usually built-in.)

Example: pip install -r requirements.txt
Database Setup: SQLite3 is usually file-based and requires no extra setup. The database file will be created automatically when the application runs for the first time or interacts with the database.
